Task:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Theoretically design an electronic circuit following the problem statement

• Calculate the value of resistors, capacitors, voltage and current sources necessary for your design

• Theoretically calculate the output voltages and currents

• Simulate your circuit using PSPICE circuit simulator and obtain the output voltages and currents 

• Compare the simulated results with the theoretically calculated results

• Analyze your designed circuit for various input conditions

Abstract:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The op amp circuit is capable of quickly solving mathematical equations, such as differential equations
in calculus. In this project we find the Second order homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equation solver 
with the help of Operational Amplifier. We will see how using the basic amplifiers we can build a 
circuit. We will first see the normal Second order Ordinary Differential Equation solver after that we 
will see the same thing for the Second order homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equation.
